- 👋 Hi, I’m @Konunkier (Jacob Freeland)
- 👀 I’m interested in how technology will play out over the next few decades.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS, JS, and I haven't decided on ReactJS or VueJS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything begginer friendly I started learning mid-march.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my email konunkier@pm.me | yes thats a real email :)
